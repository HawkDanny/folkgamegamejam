            <p><span class="pink">okay but really what is a folk game?</span>
            <br>Basically any game you've played where someone taught you the rules from memory, using few materials. Like tag, hide and go seek, red rover, the floor is lava, and slap games. </p>

            <p><span class="pink">why a game jam about folk games?</span>
            <br>No one person really makes a folk game. They're games taught from person to person, each changing it to suit the current players better, and through this they reflect the cultures and communities that they are created in.</p>

            <p><span class="pink">will there be food?</span>
            <br>We will provide bagels at 11am</p>
            
            <p><span class="pink">are there prizes?</span>
            <br>No. One of the values of the FGGJ is that it is a non stressful environment. To insure that, it is only 4 hours long, there is no expectation of success, and there is no prior knowledge or skill necessary.</p>
